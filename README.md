[![Release](https://github.com/tdurieux/EnergiBridge/actions/workflows/release.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/tdurieux/EnergiBridge/actions/workflows/release.yml) [![GitHub Release](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/tdurieux/EnergiBridge)](https://github.com/tdurieux/EnergiBridge/releases)



Energibridge is a cross-platform energy measurement utility that provides support for Linux, Windows, and MacOS, as well as Intel, AMD, and Apple ARM CPU architectures.

This tool is designed to collect resource usage data for a command to execute and to output the data in a CSV format.

## Requirements

Depending on your hardware you need different dependencies.

### NVIDIA

- nvml

## Install

### Windows

Install LibreHardwareMonitor to access the CPU registry.


In an elevated (Administrator) command line (e.g. cmd.exe):
```
Create:
sc create rapl type=kernel binPath="<absolute_path_to_LibreHardwareMonitor.sys>"

Start:
sc start rapl

Stop:
sc stop rapl

Delete:
sc delete rapl

Build:
cargo build -r
```

> For PowerShell use `sc.exe` instead of `sc`.

### Linux

Change the permission of the msr file to be able to read them without root access.
The permissions are reset each time your restart the machine.

```
sudo chgrp -R msr /dev/cpu/*/msr;
sudo chmod g+r /dev/cpu/*/msr;
```

Build EnergiBridge

```
cargo build -r;
```

Provide the permission to the binary to read the registry.
Since any non-root program accessing the msr also needs the rawio capability, if you move the binary you should eecute this line again

```
sudo setcap cap_sys_rawio=ep target/release/energibridge;
```

### MacOS

Build EnergiBridge

```
cargo build -r;
```

## Usage

To run the script, use the following command (from `./target/release`):

```
Usage: energibridge[.exe] [OPTIONS] [COMMAND]...

Arguments:
  [COMMAND]...  the command to execute

Options:
  -o, --output <OUTPUT>
          Output file to save the output of power measurements. Outputs to stdout if left blank. Overwrites the file if it already exists
  -c, --command-output <COMMAND_OUTPUT>
          Output file to save the output of the command. Outputs to stdout if left blank. Overwrites the file if it already exists
  -s, --separator <SEPARATOR>
          Define the separator between data fields [default: ,]
  -i, --interval <INTERVAL>
          Duration of the interval between two measurements in microseconds [default: 200]
  -m, --max-execution <MAX_EXECUTION>
          Define the maximum duration of the execution of the command in seconds, set to 0 to disable [default: 0]
  -g, --gpu
          Enable to measure the GPU power consumption
      --summary
          Print the summary of the energy consumption
  -h, --help
          Print help
  -V, --version
          Print version
```
